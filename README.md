# DuNet
web4.0 backbone


What will the Web4.0 be?
Web1.0 offers user information in a single direction.(1->N)
Web2.0 makes interaction and moves life behaviors instrumentally.(1<->N)
Web3.0 distributes the interactions with protocols for simulating real world.(N<->N)
Web4.0 merges the knowledge from web2.0 and the protocols from web3.0.
(N<=>N) 
For better interactions between real world (N) and web space(N = distributed web3.0 nodes or giant web2.0 nodes); we need build new backbone protocol DuNet, which will fulfil these intelligent interactions.
